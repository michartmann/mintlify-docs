    This document provides an API description in [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.1.html)
    for Bank Product Data APIs for Ozone Connect.

    These APIs should be implemented by an financial institution so that Ozone
    can expose the API operations to TPPs.

    #### Implementer Notes

    Implementers should note that this API prescribes a positive response for correctly executed
    operations including those where no data is returned. This is consistent with the general principles
    of REST.

    Please refer to the API Hub documentation for details of test cases that are 
    available for this API using the Ozone Connect test suite.

    ### Changes in Version 2024.06.0

    * Removed test case guidance and references from the API description as now 
      maintained on a API Hub documentation page.

    * Removed duplicate query parameters PageNumber and PageSize

    ### Changes in Version 2024.48.1

    * Initial revision of Bank Product Data API

  version: 2025.06.0
